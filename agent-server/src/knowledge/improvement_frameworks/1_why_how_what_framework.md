## 1. The Why–How–What Framework (Simon Sinek)
- **Why (Belief):** Start by clarifying the deeper purpose — why this improvement matters beyond metrics.
- **How (Behavior):** Identify leadership principles and team behaviors that express the belief.
- **What (Results):** Define tangible actions and outcomes that demonstrate the belief in practice.

> “People don’t buy what you do; they buy why you do it.” — Simon Sinek  
When improvement is anchored in *beliefs*, people act from conviction, not compliance.
