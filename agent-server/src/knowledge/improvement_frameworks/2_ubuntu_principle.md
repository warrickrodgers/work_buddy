## 2. The Ubuntu Principle (Nelson Mandela)
- **Philosophy:** "I am because we are."  
  Improvement is a shared human endeavor, not an individual pursuit.
- **Application:**  
  - Involve all voices in diagnosing problems.  
  - Frame improvement as mutual uplift — success for one is success for all.  
  - Celebrate collaboration, empathy, and shared ownership.

> Leadership is not domination; it is stewardship of collective potential.
