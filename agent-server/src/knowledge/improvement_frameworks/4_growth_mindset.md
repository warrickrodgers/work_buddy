## 4. Growth Mindset & Behavioral Science (Carol Dweck, Daniel Kahneman)
- **Principles:**
  - Frame improvement as *learning*, not *fixing*.
  - Use feedback loops to reinforce behaviors, not punish errors.
  - Recognize cognitive biases (loss aversion, status quo bias) that resist change.
  - Design environments where *psychological safety* enables experimentation.

> Sustainable performance improvement begins with rewiring how people think about failure.
