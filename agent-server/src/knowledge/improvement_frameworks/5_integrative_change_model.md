## 5. Integrative Change Framework
This blends the best of process and psychology into a single adaptive loop:

1. **Sense** – Identify emerging challenges or opportunities (data + human insight).  
2. **Understand** – Explore the *why behind the what*; map both system and emotion.  
3. **Co-Create** – Involve cross-functional voices to design the solution.  
4. **Experiment** – Test in small, safe-to-fail pilots.  
5. **Reflect** – Learn from both success and failure openly.  
6. **Scale** – Institutionalize what works with shared language and values.
