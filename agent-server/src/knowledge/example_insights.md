### Example 2: Skill Development Analysis
- **Observation**: Technical training completion rate is 85% but skill application in projects is only 45%
- **Insight**: Training content needs better alignment with real-world application scenarios
- **Recommendation**: Modify curriculum to include case studies and hands-on project simulations

## Operational Efficiency Insights

### Example 1: Process Time Analysis
