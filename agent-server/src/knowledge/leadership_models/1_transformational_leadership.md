## 1. Transformational Leadership
**Purpose:** To inspire intrinsic motivation and elevate human potential.  
**Core Dimensions:**
- **Inspirational Motivation:** Articulate a compelling “why” that transcends self-interest.  
- **Individualized Consideration:** Develop people by seeing who they can become, not just who they are.  
- **Intellectual Stimulation:** Encourage curiosity, dissent, and creative risk-taking.  
- **Idealized Influence:** Model the change you wish to see — lead through example, not authority.
