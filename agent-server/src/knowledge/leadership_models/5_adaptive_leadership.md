## 5. Adaptive Leadership (Heifetz)
**Purpose:** To navigate complex change and uncertainty by mobilizing learning and resilience.  
**Principles:**
- Distinguish technical from adaptive challenges.  
- Protect voices of dissent and difference.  
- Regulate distress to maintain productive tension.  
- Give the work back to the people closest to the problem.  
- Build systemic capacity for reflection and adaptation.

> Adaptive leaders hold space for discomfort because growth lives there.
