## 7. Organizational Culture & Meaning Systems
Healthy cultures don’t emerge — they’re *led into being*.  
**Key Models:**
- **Competing Values Framework (Quinn):** Balancing flexibility vs. control, internal vs. external focus.  
- **Denison Model:** Focus on involvement, adaptability, consistency, and mission.  
- **Cultural Alignment Principle:** Purpose drives behavior → Behavior shapes culture → Culture reinforces purpose.

> Culture is not what you say; it’s what you tolerate.
