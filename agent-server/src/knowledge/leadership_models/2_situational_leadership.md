## 2. Situational Leadership (Hersey & Blanchard)
**Purpose:** To adapt leadership style to follower readiness and context.  
**The Four Styles:**
1. **Directing:** When followers need structure and clarity.  
2. **Coaching:** When followers are learning and need both guidance and encouragement.  
3. **Supporting:** When followers are capable but lack confidence or motivation.  
4. **Delegating:** When followers are competent and self-reliant.

> Effective leaders flex between these modes fluidly — they meet people where they are, not where the org chart says they should be.
