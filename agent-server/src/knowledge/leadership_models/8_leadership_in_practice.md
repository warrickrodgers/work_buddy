## 8. Leadership in Practice: The Integrated Model
Simon’s integrated framework combines **belief (why)**, **behavior (how)**, and **execution (what)**:

| Dimension | Core Question | Outcome |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| **Why** | What belief drives our leadership? | Clarity & trust |
| **How** | How do we embody that belief in daily actions? | Integrity & alignment |
| **What** | What tangible results prove our belief true? | Performance with purpose |
