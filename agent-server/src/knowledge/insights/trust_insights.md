# Leadership Trust & Communication Insights

## Increased Anonymous Feedback

### Observation
Spike in anonymous feedback forms over the last quarter.

### Insight
Employees may not feel safe giving feedback directly — a signal of trust erosion. When people hide behind anonymity, it reveals fear of consequences or judgment.

Trust isn't built through open-door policies; it's built through consistent, vulnerable leadership.

### Recommendation
Leaders should model vulnerability by publicly acknowledging mistakes and acting transparently on team input.

Create spaces where feedback is not just welcomed but visibly acted upon. Show that speaking up leads to positive change, not punishment.

### Related Principle
"Trust is earned in drops and lost in buckets." - Build psychological safety through consistent, authentic actions, not policies.
