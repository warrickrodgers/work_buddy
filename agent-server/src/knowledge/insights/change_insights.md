## Morale Decline After Restructure

### Observation
Sentiment analysis of internal messages shows a 20% drop in positive tone post-restructure.

### Insight
Structural change without emotional acknowledgment creates resistance. People don't resist change; they resist feeling unheard during change.

Logic announces change; emotion processes it. You can't think your way through loss — you have to feel it.

### Recommendation
Leaders should hold open forums to validate concerns and invite co-creation of the new chapter — not just communicate top-down updates.

Give people voice, not just information. Let them grieve what's ending before asking them to embrace what's beginning. Change imposed feels like loss; change co-created feels like evolution.

### Related Principle
"Change happens at the speed of trust, not the speed of urgency." - Honor the human timeline, not just the business timeline.
