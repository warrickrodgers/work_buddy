# Resilience & Stress Management Insights

## Increased Absenteeism During Uncertainty

### Observation
Sick days rise during periods of change or layoffs.

### Insight
Stress is often a silent signal of emotional fatigue, not disloyalty. When people physically withdraw, they're often emotionally overwhelmed.

Absence isn't always about sickness; it's sometimes about survival.

### Recommendation
Normalize emotional check-ins and offer resilience programs focused on meaning, not just mindfulness.

Create space to talk about fear, loss, and uncertainty openly. Resilience isn't about "toughing it out" — it's about processing emotions in community. Help people find meaning in the struggle, not just tools to endure it.

"You can't build resilience without first acknowledging pain." - Strength comes from processing, not suppressing.
