# Team Engagement & Motivation Insights

## Declining Meeting Participation

### Observation
Meeting attendance has dropped 30% over the past month.

### Insight
This may reflect psychological disengagement or lack of perceived value in meetings — not just scheduling conflicts. When people stop showing up, they're telling you the meeting doesn't serve their sense of purpose or contribution.

### Recommendation
Reframe meetings around shared purpose and open dialogue. Ask, "What value does this create for us?" instead of "What updates do we have?"

Transform meetings from information dumps into spaces for meaningful connection and problem-solving. People attend when they feel heard and when their presence matters.

### Related Principle
"People don't need more meetings; they need more meaning." - Start with why the meeting exists before defining what it covers.
