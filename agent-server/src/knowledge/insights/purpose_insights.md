# Cultural Alignment & Purpose Insights

## High Turnover in High-Performing Teams

### Observation
Top-performing employees are leaving despite strong results.

### Insight
Achievement without alignment to purpose leads to burnout — people don't leave companies, they leave meaning.

High performance without purpose is exhausting. People need to know not just that they're succeeding, but *why* it matters.

### Recommendation
Reinforce the "why" behind each goal. Celebrate contributions that express company values, not just hit metrics.

Connect daily work to larger impact. Help people see how their efforts serve something beyond quarterly numbers. Recognition should honor character and purpose, not just output.
