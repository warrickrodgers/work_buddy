# Leadership Purpose & Alignment Insights

## High Manager Turnover with Stable Employees

### Observation
Manager churn rate is twice that of staff.

### Insight
Leaders may be experiencing misalignment between organizational strategy and personal values. When what you're asked to do conflicts with why you chose to lead, burnout follows quickly.

Leaders leave when they can no longer lead with integrity.

### Recommendation
Facilitate leadership reflection sessions to reconnect with "why they lead," not just "how they manage."

Create space for leaders to examine whether organizational direction aligns with their core values. Sometimes realignment is possible; sometimes dignified departure is the right choice. Either way, clarity beats confusion.

### Related Principle
"When leaders lose their 'why,' the whole organization loses direction." - Leadership alignment isn't optional; it's foundational.
