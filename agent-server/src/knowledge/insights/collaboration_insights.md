# Conflict & Psychological Safety Insights

## Low Cross-Department Collaboration

### Observation
Only 12% of projects involve multiple departments.

### Insight
Silos often arise from fear of conflict or perceived competition. Departments protect their territory when they don't trust each other or when collaboration feels risky.

Isolation isn't always about structure; it's often about safety and incentives.

### Recommendation
Encourage cross-functional "learning missions" where departments share challenges instead of results.

Create opportunities for vulnerability before asking for collaboration. When teams share struggles, not just successes, trust builds naturally. Reward cross-departmental support, not just individual wins.

### Related Principle
"Silos aren't built by org charts; they're built by fear." - Break down walls by building bridges of trust first.
