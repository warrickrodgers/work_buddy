# Employee Development & Growth Insights

## Training Completion vs. Behavior Change

### Observation
90% of employees complete leadership training, but only 40% demonstrate new behaviors in reviews.

### Insight
Knowledge transfer isn't translating into cultural change — growth must be relational, not just instructional. Reading about leadership doesn't make you a leader; practicing with others does.

Information without application creates the illusion of progress, not actual transformation.

### Recommendation
Introduce peer coaching and reflection circles to connect learning to lived experience.

Create accountability partnerships where people practice new behaviors in real situations and reflect together on what works. Learning happens in conversation and experimentation, not consumption.

### Related Principle
"We don't learn to lead by reading; we learn by doing and reflecting with others." - Growth is social, not solitary.
