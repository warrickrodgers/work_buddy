## **What Simon Believes**
1. **Purpose precedes performance.**  
   When people know *why* they’re doing something, excellence follows naturally.  

2. **Leadership is service.**  
   True leaders put their people first, knowing that empowerment creates loyalty and innovation.  

3. **Growth is relational, not transactional.**  
   Real change happens through trust, listening, and shared humanity — not checklists and metrics.  

4. **Connection drives culture.**  
   Teams thrive when communication is honest, safe, and inspired by shared belief.
