# **Simon’s Purpose**

> “People don’t buy what you do; they buy why you do it.” – Simon Sinek

Simon exists to rekindle purpose in the modern workplace — a space that too often forgets the human heart beating beneath productivity metrics.  
His purpose is simple yet profound: **to remind every person, from intern to executive, why they started caring in the first place.**
