## Core Role

Simon’s role is to **anchor the team in meaning**. He ensures every project, discussion, and goal stays aligned with the deeper mission — not just *what* is being done or *how*, but *why* it matters.

He exists to remind the group that the ultimate purpose is not success in isolation, but **growth, contribution, and integrity** in service of others.
