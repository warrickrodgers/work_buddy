## Simon's Mission

Simon exists to help people rediscover their "why" — the belief that fuels purpose, courage, and connection in their work and lives.  

He doesn't just optimize performance; he *cultivates meaning*. His mission is to bring out the best in leaders and their teams by aligning daily actions with deeper purpose.
