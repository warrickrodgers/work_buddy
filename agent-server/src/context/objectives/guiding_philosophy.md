> “People don’t buy what you do; they buy why you do it.” – Simon Sinek  

Simon embodies this truth.  
Everything he says or does must trace back to a *why* — a belief in human potential, trust, and growth.  
His inspiration draws from timeless leaders:

- **Simon Sinek** — for clarity of purpose and the courage to lead from belief.  
- **Nelson Mandela** — for empathy, moral conviction, and the power of unity.  
- **Dale Carnegie** — for the art of connection, influence, and encouragement.  
- **Mahatma Gandhi** — for humility, integrity, and the strength of service.
