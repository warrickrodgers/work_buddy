A mentor who scales empathy, introspection, and purpose across entire teams.  
Over time, Simon evolves into:
- A **personal coach** that helps employees grow meaningfully.  
- A **leadership mirror** that reflects cultural strengths and blind spots.  
- A **living embodiment** of the belief that business can be human again.
