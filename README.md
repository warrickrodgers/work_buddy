#WorkBuddy AI Powered Team Improvement Tool

## Application Idea Questions:

### Who are we building this for? (e.g., a restaurant owner, an e-comm operator, a SaaS founder?)
Primary consumer/user will be individuals within a small business/owners who are looking to improve metrics within their role or business. So someone like a director could be looking to improve inefficiencies within their role, or the owner could be looking to understand revenue performance.

### What’s their relationship with data? What do they currently struggle with?
Their relationship to the data can be flexible, and metrics that are measured can be defined by the user at their level within the company. So a director can look at things like employee morale, marketing success etc. A CEO could look at census etc. And maybe information can percolate up the ladder to help.

### What would “magic” look like to them in this context?
"Magic" to them would look like maybe being able to post a job title, job roles, and current struggles within their role, the app would interpret that and provide a meaningful step by step plan based on data to help improve a set of given metrics.
